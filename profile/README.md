# TOOTATIS

> **TOOTAtIs** — TOOlset for consTrAint programmIng.

A community-driven suite of tools to support Constraint Programming (CP) research, development, and applications.

## 🚀 About TOOTATIS

Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for solving complex combinatorial problems across a wide range of domains.  
Over the years, many solvers and tools have been developed, but their interoperability remains limited.

TOOTATIS addresses this challenge by offering a modular ecosystem that fosters integration, experimentation, and ease of use across different solvers, formats, and languages.

Initially centered around the **Universe** library, TOOTATIS has evolved to encompass a broader collection of complementary tools for modeling, solving, and analyzing constraint-based problems.


Our toolset includes solutions for:

- 📦 Solver installation and management
- 📊 Experimentation and performance analysis
- 🛠️ Solver configuration standardization
- 🔗 Integration with modern development environments (e.g., VSCode)
